# SLAM-Simultaneous-localization-and-mapping-
In robotic mapping and navigation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. This application is being developed and maintained for Titan Rover.
